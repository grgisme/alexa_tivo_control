Welcome to TiVo Control. You can use this skill to control your TiVo with your Amazon Echo and Alexa voice control.

All of the voice commands start with 'Alexa, tell/ask TiVo to ...':

CONTROL
... change/go to channel <channel number>
... force channel <channel number> (cancels recording if necessary)
<channel number> must be a channel enabled in your Channel List. (Note: changing channels is not currently supported on the TiVo Mini)
... pause
... play
... (double/triple) fast forward 
... skip/advance ahead (30 second skip)
... skip commercials (for SkipMode-enabled recordings)
... (double/triple) rewind
... replay (sends instant replay twice)
... record this show

FEATURES
... turn on/off captions
... turn on/off/toggle QuickMode

PLACES
... go to Live TV
... go Home/TiVo Central
... go to/show My Shows/Now Playing
... go to/show my OnePasses
... go to/show my WishLists
... go to/show my To Do List
... search
... browse
... go to/show my history
... what to watch

PROVIDERS
... launch/start/open <provider name>
... list providers (also adds a card to your Alexa app listing all available providers)

ADVANCED
... send the command <command>

<command> can be any command defined in the TiVo TCP Remote Protocol. For example:
- KEYBOARD commands (letters, numbers, etc.)
- IRCODE commands (thumbs up/down, navigation (up, down, left, right), etc.)

Sending individual commands to the TiVo with Alexa can be cumbersome since each command needs to be issued separately (i.e., 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the command down', 'Alexa, tell TiVo to send the command select'). For complex interactions, using the physical remote control is the better method.
